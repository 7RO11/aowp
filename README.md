Anarchy Online Weapon Pathing "aowp" is a web tool to help Anarchy Online players decide what weapons they want to use.

The goal of aowp is a tailored, guided experience that will land a user on weapon they can obtain and use. It will exclude a lot of common pool options that may be viable, but less than ideal.

AOWP is an opinion piece more than database dump. Weapon blurbs are subjective to my own biases and experiences as a largely froob 1-150 player.
What I may consider "difficult to obtain" could be trivial if you have someone or something (ao#, level 200 osbs) hand it to you.
